## UPDuino v3.0: PCB Design Files, Designs, Documentation

The UPDuino v3.0 is a small, low cost FPGA board. The board features an on-board FPGA programmer, flash and LED with _all_ FPGA pins brought out to easy to use 0.1" header pins for fast prototyping.

The tinyVision.ai UPduino v3.0 Board Features:

* Lattice UltraPlus ICE40UP5K FPGA with 5.3K LUTs, 1Mb SPRAM, 120Kb DPRAM, 8 Multipliers
* FTDI FT232H USB to SPI Device
* _ALL_ 32 FPGA GPIO on 0.1‚Äù headers
* 4MB SPI Flash
* RGB LED
* On board 3.3V and 1.2V Regulators, can supply 3.3V to your project
* Open source schematic and layout using KiCAD design tools
* Integrated into the open source [APIO toolchain](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio)


Please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/UPduino-v3.0/wiki) for the changes that were implemented from v2.1. Some salient features are:
* 4 layer board with a solid ground plane, proper layout and decoupling for good signal integrity and FPGA operation
* Access to on-board 12MHz oscillator using a jumper
* _All_ FPGA pins including LED driver pins are brought to 0.1" headers
* qSPI Flash capable
* tinyFPGA bootloader compatible
